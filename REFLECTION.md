## Reflection

**Were your predictions accurate?**  
Yes. Physical activities were the most frequent category, and hiking had the highest enjoyment.

**What surprised you about your week?**  
I thought reading would be the most enjoyable activity, but enjoyable does not equal rewarding. The most enjoyable activity (hiking) required the most effort, while reading stood out as a low-effort but still high-enjoyment activity.

**Which higher-order function was most useful and why?**  
`filter()` was the most useful because it helped isolate specific patterns, like physical activities or afternoon habits, before summarizing them with `reduce()`.
